It s him.
Mark then makes the same plea.
His impostor did.
Wanda asks.
Mark slaps.
Why would the Darkness destroy Yugopotamia but not the rest.
Cosmo guesses.
Perhaps the Darkness is only  because since he was the one to defeat it  the Darkness wants to take him out before going after the rest of the universe.
Realizing  Timmy says.
The Darkness is back.
They must go and find Turbo Thunder so that he could defeat the Darkness.
But they arrive too late.

When Timmy says that the Darkness is coming back.
Thinking  they go back.
They missed an important part.
Jorgen insists.
There is nt a part  having the eyes of eagle  the speed of a puma  and the wisdom of a great horned owl.
Timmy corrects him.
There s a second wand.
The eyes hamper.
I still have the strength.
Cosmo also notices.

Jorgen is optimistic.
Wanda cries.
Timmy is hurling to find the second wand and save them all.

Mr Turner asks and tries reminding them.
If Timmy could ve wished away his man-flab  Jorgen snaps that he could ve.
They must break out.
Unfortunately  an Eliminator hears him and marches up  Jorgen tries correcting his statement to say.
He s hungry.
The Eliminator offers chicken fingers.
Mr Turner declines.
Poof busts out and defeats the Eliminators with his martial arts skills  before setting everyone free.
Jorgen then declares.
They must now join forces  only to reminded that they do nt have wands.
Therefore  they all disguise themselves.
Eliminators to retrieve the wands.
But Jorgen is reminded once again.
They do nt know where Timmy is.
Dark Laser suggests they go.
There is no food.
Crocker panics  knowing.
It s the most coldest planet.
Arriving  they attempt to sit down for snacks.
Unfortunately  every other patron is an Eliminator.
They capture Vicky  Crocker and Dark Laser and add their weapons to their arsenal.
Timmy tries reasoning with them.
They want Turbo Thunder.
He then shakes the head Eliminator s hand  causing them all to malfunction and shut down.
Mark perceives.
He defeated them  though Timmy says that he simply was trying to be nice  to which Mark says works too.
Timmy then runs outside  proclaiming.
He is the Chosen One.
It is then.
The Darkness arrives.
Mark shouts.
What does that thing want.
Which the Darkness moans Timmy s name.
Luckily  they are saved  bringing them to Thunder World  his amusement park.
He plans to open once he defeats the Darkness.
But  Turbo Thunder insists.
When said black hole follows them.
Timmy tells him where the second wand is.
Timmy agrees  but only.
Turbo takes him and Mark.
But Turbo Thunder had lied  leaving Timmy and Mark to the mercy of the Darkness.
To save their lives  Mark swallows Timmy whole and stows away before take off  though unknown and unseen by Turbo Thunder.
They reach the Blue Moon and Mark regurgitates Timmy.
Timmy is just about to get the second wand and is revealed  thus Timmy passed the test.
He IS the true Chosen One because he refused to fight the guardian while Turbo Thunder did  only to be flicked away.
Unfortunately  the Darkness arrives and sucks.
The head Eliminator snatches the wand.
Meanwhile  Timmy s enemies are being carted off  still frozen.
They are freed and once informed of Timmy s whereabouts  he quickly poofs them to the blue moon of Veegon  and promises.
Where Timmy is taunted that no magic wand can stop them.
They will keep coming back than before.
Luckily  Timmy s friends and family arrive and successfully drives the Eliminators back.
Timmy is more than grateful.
They saved him.
Chester reminds Timmy.
The Darkness is still bearing down.
But an even bigger concern is  nothing happened.
When Timmy tries to use the second wand to force the Darkness away.
The Darkness then tries inhaling everyone.
Only Jorgen is the anchor  keeping everyone from being sucked in.
He asks Timmy to just say the word.
He ll poof them all away.
But Timmy knows.
No matter where he goes  the Darkness will follow him.
Mr Turner cries out.
What does it even wants.
The Darkness answers.
Realizing  Timmy climbs the rope.
The Darkness wants only him.
His friends and family made.
Where Trixie kisses Timmy before he willingly releases his grip and gets pulled into the Darkness.
The Darkness leaves.
Everyone is heartbroken.
Jorgen and the others firmly decide.
Since Timmy sacrificed himself to save them  it was now THEIR turn to save him  before he foolishly created a rocket ship using magic and then accidentally launched it away it first.
The scene then pans out.
The Darkness comes.
This is the first Fairly Odd Parents episode or movie.

What happened.
It turns out to be a terrible day  so he wishes to start the day over ever.
But  a trio burst through the wall.
He could kiss Trixie.
Timmy attempts to leap to find out.
The Eliminators are Jorgen  Wanda and Cosmo.
Timmy is still inside the Darkness  using an illusion to keep him distracted from fulfilling his Chosen One destiny.
He tries denying it.
Trixie turns.
Timmy is able to escape the Darkness.
The Darkness now wants Timmy safely back.

Nonetheless   he reassembles himself and takes off to face Timmy.

Their magic wands vanish.
But  the Eliminator was targeted from MERF.
He can finish Timmy.
He managed to absorb a high number  taking a massive change in appearance.
The Eliminator uses.
Its new found magical powers to completely solidify the Earth and change all the humans into his robotic henchmen as Timmy and his fairies escape in a MERF escape probe.
The Eliminator then decides to call himself the Destructinator.
Jorgen   escapes becoming a robot  but realizes.
Who was granted rocket gluts.
He has no magic.
Timmy and his fairies return to retrieve the second wand and run into a weakened Turbo Thunder.
He then reveals the true reason.
The second wand did nothing when Timmy used it.
It s true purpose was to light the way.
It was then revealed that.
It revealed the final part.
Where Timmy would have to find a third and final wand  hidden.
Turbo Thunder reveals  but.
He was the original Chosen One  picked.
Timmy had to fill in  he apologizes and admits.
Timmy is the new chosen one.
He also tells them.
He tried out to become the chosen one to take revenge because it destroyed his home world of Wonder World and took his family from him.
Turbo Thunder tries to train Timmy but Timmy s unable to keep up powered teacher.
Thus  Turbo Thunder transfers his powers.
Who dubs himself Turbo Timmy  knowing he was the only hope.
The group returns and frees the fairies by giving them wands from the hidden ruins below the moon and fight back the remaining Eliminators.
Timmy then returns to face the Destructinator as the Darkness catches word.
Timmy has returned.
Jorgen  poorly disguised as robot  walks up to the robotic MERF agents to ask.
What s happening.
The Destructinator then comes down and grabs him  stating.
He s filling Earth with enough explosives that will destroy the Darkness at its one weak spot  its heart.
He then proceeds to play around  giving Jorgen giants ears  before having him strapped to a chair to witness the explosive-stuffed Earth destroy both the Darkness and Timmy.
Jorgen points out.
The MERF agents gives the Destructinator the detonator.
He can not blow up the Chosen One or the Darkness when they re not here.
He is soon prove wrong.
When both arrive on Earth.
The Destructinator quickly captures Timmy.
It is then.
Jorgen hears a thousand fairies raising their wands.
All the fairies restore the Earth to normal with their magic  as well as freeing Timmy and Jorgen.
But the Destructinator jumps in to remind them.
He s still standing.
Timmy walks up to mock his attempts and leads the Destructinator on a chase through space  as the fairies search the Earth for the ice wand.
But he soon makes the mistake.
The Destructinator then sends Timmy crashing.
He gloats that because  he now has magic and all the power in the universe.
Timmy adds  tricking the Destructinator.
He technically does nt.
All the weapons stuffed  causing him to grow larger  before he reveals to him that he snatched the detonator from him in space.
He then detonates the bombs  destroying the Destructinator once and.
The massive explosion also melts the ice and reveals the third and final wand.
Now   Timmy must now fulfill the prophecy and defeat the Darkness.
But just then  he realizes something.
It was first attacked  the Darkness was merely defending itself.
