The film covers Karen Carpenter to her untimely death by cardiac arrest in.
The movie begins Agnes Carpenter discovering Karen s body in her parents  Downey  California home on February 4  1983  and then returns by flashback to.
The story touches from 1966 on  the duo s signing with record label A&M their initial success and subsequent decline Karen s development of anorexia nervosa her on-stage collapse in Las Vegas her search for treatment for her anorexia nervosa her attempt to restart her career.
Claim that she gradually developed a reliance.
An unusual facet was.
Instead  almost all parts were played by modified Barbie dolls.
Haynes detailed Karen Carpenter s worsening anorexia by subtly whittling away at the face and arms of the Karen Barbie doll.
Sets were created properly scaled.
Interspersed were documentary-style segments detailing the times and also detailing anorexia  these segments were seen as dry and melodramatic parodies of the documentary genre.
Which Karen Carpenter lived.
The underlying soundtrack included many popular hits  including songs by Gilbert OSullivan  Elton John  Leon Russell and the Carpenters themselves.
The tone was sympathetic to Karen  especially in regards to her anorexia.
Much was gained by making the other characters as unsympathetic as possible.
Karen s parents  Harold and Agnes  were portrayed.
After she turned.
The duo s initial meeting was intercut with stock footage of Vietnam War scenes.
Richard Carpenter was portrayed.
Who frequently sided against Karen  and was also depicted as more concerned with his and Karen s careers than with Karen s health.
This culminated  What are you trying to do.
Haynes even insinuated - which   would have destroyed the Carpenters  clean-cut image and the group s career.
Richard was homosexual.
It had been reported.
Haynes  treatment was quite dark  his choice of black captions often blended in with the scene  rendering them unreadable.
Additionally  Haynes worked spanking with a repeated segment featuring a black-and-white overhead view of someone  possibly Harold  administering an over-the-knee spanking to a bare-bottomed adult Karen.
The meaning is never discussed  leaving it to the viewer s imagination - it may be an actual event  a representation of Karen s self-loathing regarding her inability to be the perfect child  or a representation of the self-discipline involved with her anorexia.

Omana had committed suicide below.
Varma questions the members as well as neighbors and servants about Omana s relationship with her husband Sunny.
Sunny admits she died and throwing her onto their bed before leaving to drink  but swears he never hit her.
He also tells Varma.
Omana had attempted suicide before.
Ouseppachan claims.
He came home that night  dropped off by his driver  Vasu  only to find himself locked out of the house.
He decided to go around the back.
Where the cook s quarters were located when he stumbled.
Dissatisfied from several suspects  Varma immediately suspects foul play and is determined to find the truth.

Omana died at 8pm the previous night.
Omana s cousin Chacko  a police officer working  finds this autopsy report suspicious and tells Varma and Officer Alex.
He has doubts.

It rained severely Omana allegedly committed suicide.
Her corpse would have been wet.
She had died.
The blood would have been mixed in with the rain water.

Later that week  Iyer and his team bring two dummies the same height and weight to Ouseppachan s house.
They take the dummies to roof and drop one straight.
As if it jumped  and threw the other.
If someone had thrown the body.
They find  and concluded.
Omana s body landed approximately as the dummy that was thrown.
She could not have jumped that far.
Next  they decide to track down Ouseppachan s driver  Vasu.
Who has been missing after Omana s death.
Harry finds out.
Vasu had given a local banker some jewelry for a loan.
Was a bracelet belonging to Omana.
Immediately put all suspicion.
They finally find him and take him.
Where he confesses that shortly after he got home  Narayan came to his house and told him that Sunny had accidentally killed Omana during a domestic dispute.
Vasu then said.
Narayan and the others implored him to carry Omana s body to the roof and fling her off.
It was alone with Omana s dead body.
Vasu had noticed her gold bracelet and decided to steal it.
Iyer is not convinced.
Sunny had left the house after hitting Omana.
That would mean.
She died.
However  Iyer examines photographs and finds.
Omana still bled when she was dropped some 2 hours later.
She could not have died.
Dead bodies do not retain heat thus causing the blood.
Iyer notices a small blood stain on Omana s saree below the waist.
Iyer is convinced.
The autopsy report stated that she sustained no injuries.
The blood was left behind.
They find.
It is O-negative  a rare blood type.
Remembering  Iyer goes and finds.
The town had imposed mandatory blood tests recently by the local authorities to combat malaria.
The blood type was so rare that only two people had it.
Iyer arrives at Ouseppachan s house with a large police backup unit and places Ouseppachan under arrest for the murder of Omana.
Shocked  Ouseppachan vehemently denies killing her.
Iyer would not relent.
Seeing his father being arrested.
He committed.
He killed Omana accidentally.
Iyer tells Sunny.
Omana did not die when he hit her  that she only fainted.
Iyer then goes on to explain.
The blood  which did not match her own  was left behind by the real killer.
He informs them.
One is Johny  Ouseppachan s.
Confronted  Johny confesses Omana had died.
He had come the night.
Finding her passed out   he suffocated her to death.
He attempted to rape her  but when she woke up and started screaming.

Is her daughter  Beth.
Who is her full time caregiver -- which she resents bitterly -- and a musician.
Seldom quotes Wittgenstein s Tractatus to deny the possibility of absolute truth.
Hoping to impress his idol  Martin disputes this  asserting his faith  I believe in the number pi.
Seldom humiliates him  ridiculing his arguments and making him look foolish.
Disillusioned  Martin decides to abandon his studies and goes.
There  he encounters his office-mate  a bitter mathematician Podorov.
Who also failed to become a student.
Martin then returns.
Where he finds Seldom arriving to visit Mrs Eagleton.
The two men enter the house together and find Martin s landlady murdered.

He had received a note.

Seldom is an authority.
A serial killer is using murder.
The only perfect crime is not the one  but the one.
Exists. 
Remains unsolved.

Elijah wood  Hollywood Reporter.
June 28  2010  the credit   goes to Guillermo Martinez Martin and Seldom discuss.
Was highlighted.
Easily the murder might have been overlooked  particularly as she already suffered from terminal cancer.
Martin suggests - meaning.
The murderer is committing ` imperceptible murders.
The killer is choosing victims who are already dying therefore meaning that the police would be less likely to suspect foul play.

Afterwards  Seldom tells Martin a story.
Who had written a diary listing ways to kill his wife.
She killed her husband but was acquitted.
When the wife discovered the diary.
Decades later  the diary was discovered to have been forged.
Seldom uses this story to explain.
The perfect crime is not one which is never solved  but one which is solved incorrectly.
All is excited.
A local researcher claims to have solved Fermat s last theorem.
The Mathemeticians  including Seldom and Martin board a bus to head.
Martin jumps out.
The two reconcile and agree to take a long vacation away.
Martin realizes.
The sequence the killer has sent them all consist and that the fourth one will be a tetractys  consisting of ten points.
The police  thinking  believe.
The killer is obsessed.
He means to target the bus which Seldom and the other mathematicians are.
However  the killer   is actually the man.
Martin realizes.
He had met.
The man is a bus driver.
Seeing the students as unfit to live and wanting to provide organ donors to save his own daughter s life he blows up his bus  killing the children inside and himself.
Afterwards the police theorize and had committed the other murders to present the deaths of the schoolchildren as the work of a serial killer  thus shifting blame from himself.
He had planned to escape the blast alive.
Afterwards  Lorna and Martin prepare to leave Oxford.
However  Martin realizes.
Seldom has been lying.
Martin travels to meet Seldom.
Lorna leaves.
He explains.
What he has figured out.
Beth  wanting to be relieved  had murdered the old woman.
The police had initially suspected.
She had called Seldom.
Who came over to help cover up the crime.
But Seldom arrived.
As Martin did and so could not clean up the crime scene.
Instead he invented the story.
Order to throw suspicion off.
The man had died of natural causes with Seldom merely creating a fake injection mark and leaving a symbol behind.
The death was a fortuitous accident.
Seldom took advantage.
Seldom argues.
While he did indeed lie  his actions resulted.
However  Martin points out.
The bus bomber took his inspiration.
Seldom counters.
All actions have unintended consequences and that Martin s flirtations had led to her murdering her mother.
The characters debate several mathematical  physical and philosophical concepts Heisenberg s Principle of Uncertainty  Godel s Theorem  circles  the Vesica Piscis  the possibility of perfect crime  Fermat s Last Theorem and its proof by Professor Wiles  the Taniyama conjecture  the tetraktys and the Pythagoreans.
There are references  also.
Logic series is not actually an established topic.
Contrary.
What Seldom states at the beginning of the film.
It is not expressed  the argument is rather a philosophical argument expressed in normal  albeit idiosyncratic  language.

Louis easily carries edith  tiny and wasted away  into her bedroom and tucks her into bed.
Though he is carrying a swaddled infant.

She could do it again as she knows him so well.
She and Al work together to try to train her to mount him again  much the same way she.
Doc once worked together earlier to train her to do so.
She is stubborn and refuses to give up.
Al forces her to accept the fact.
It is impossible.
She spends some quiet time that night.
The next day   Marie is locked in her dressing room.
Sonora climbs the platform.
The crowd does nt know.

She s blind.

He sends several to Mondo Island  claiming.
Who  posing  collect Carl  Jiro  and Susan.
Kong has swum ashore.
The trio are suspicious  but can do nothing.
They are flown off.
Meanwhile  Dr Hu decides to try another method.
His reason were not only for their familiarity with Kong  but for the ape s relationship with Susan Watson in particular.
Kong had been so infatuated by Watson.
He began to listen and do what she asked.
He is not willing to wait to arrive and puts an alternative idea to the test.
Dr Hu believed that he could use this connection to get Kong to extract the Element X.

Apparently this is a good enough reason to risk his life  so Akiko sees Takashi off.
But would nt you know it  the local officials have decided to drop depth charges.
They can scare the lake s unwelcome denizen up.
Akiko rushes back and puts on her scuba gear  then heads back to the lake in time to save her shell shocked lover.
