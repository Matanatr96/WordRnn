Who starts the whole story based to her brother.
Daryush Shokof suggested.
He specifically wanted to show the important role and how he admires their courage and honesty.
Therefore he wanted to glorify the essence.
Where such a characteristic has always been a most admirable quality owned.
He also added.
It was important to have a Moslem woman taking charge and initiate a lovable relationship to a man rather than the other way around which is usually the standard cliche for all macho driven films coming from Iran  where a Moslem man gets the girl regardless of her ethnicity and origin.
Another major factor is simply to show.
He adds.
How absolutely unimportant the role should be in our times and in 2011  without any disrepect to any religion and that religions should never play a role in affairs of human beings with one another.

She asks where the grave is until she finally gets a hint and shows her the Synegouge building in the city and suggests she ask the Grand Rabbi for the whereabouts of the grave in town.
Atossa  meets the Rabbi  played.
The Rabbi takes her and convinces her of the site being the right location to look for the grave.
He cleverly indicates.
If she truly looks  then she might as well assume the whole area and or perhaps the whole Germany to be the grave of Hitler  and that she does not have to look for mysterious answers and assume further speculations to continue with her mission.
Atossa is now overjoyed  convinced  and most happy to have found the answer and is positively motivated again to continue her mission.

Connects.
