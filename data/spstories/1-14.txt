The story begins.
Where a teenage boy is on trial for stabbing his father to death.
Final closing arguments are presented.
The judge then instructs the jury to decide.
Whether the boy is guilty.
The judge further informs them.
A guilty verdict will be accompanied.
The twelve-man jury retires.
Where they spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating.
It is immediately apparent.
The jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty  and that they plan to return their verdict quickly  - with the sole exception of Juror Number.
His is the only not guilty vote.
He explains.
There is too much to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first.
His vote annoys the other jurors  particularly Juror.
Who has tickets.
The rest centers around the jury s difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict.
Juror 8 maintains.
Several harbor personal prejudices.
The evidence presented is circumstantial  and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation.
He calls.
He further argues.
He can not vote guilty when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy s guilt.
Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response  Juror 8 reluctantly agrees.
All he seems to be accomplishing is hanging the jury.
He takes a bold gamble  He requests another vote  this time.
He proposes.
He will abstain.
Then he will acquiesce.
The other eleven jurors are still unanimous.
The secret ballot is held.
A new not guilty vote appears.
Juror 9 is the first to support Juror 8  feeling.
His points deserve further discussion.
Juror 5 - - changes his vote.
Juror 8 presents a convincing argument that one  who claimed to have heard the boy yell I m going to kill you shortly before the murder took place  could not have heard the voices as clearly as he had testified  as well as stating that I m going to kill you  is said constantly and never meant literally.
Who had grown up.
This earns intense criticism.
Who accuses.
Soon afterward  Juror 11 questions also changes his vote.
Whether the defendant would have reasonably fled the scene and come back three hours later to retrieve the knife  then.
Juror 8 then uses another scheme to question the witness s other claim.
Upon hearing the murder  he had gone and seen the defendant running out of the building  as the witness in question had an injured leg which limits his ability to walk.
The jury finds.
The witness would nt have made it to actually see the defendant running out.
And come.
Judging  the witness must have merely assumed it was the defendant running.
Juror 3  growing more irritated  explodes in a rant  He s got to burn.
Juror 3 shouts.
I ll kill him.
8 calmly retorts  You do nt really mean  do you.
You ll kill me.
2 and 6 also decide to vote not guilty  tying the vote at.
The storm breaks  it begins to rain heavily.
Juror 7 finds.
Trying the fan  which had previously not been working.
It is now working.
Increasingly impatient  Juror 7 changes his vote.
So that the deliberation may end.
Earns him nothing.
However  Juror 7 insists.
When scathingly pressed about using his vote frivolously.
He truly believes the defendant is not guilty because he has come to have a reasonable doubt.
Juror 2 calls the prosecution s claim.
The accused  who was nearly a foot shorter  was able to stab him in such a way as to inflict the downward stab wound found on the body.
Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see.
It s possible to stab downward into a taller person.
The experiment proves.
It s possible.
Juror 5 then explains.
He had grown up amidst knife fights  and shows  through demonstrating the correct use of a switchblade  that no one so much shorter than his opponent would have held a switchblade in such a way as to stab downward  as it would have been too awkward.
This revelation augments the certainty.
The defendant is not guilty.
The next jurors are Jurors 12 and 1  making the vote.
To change their votes.
The only dissenters left are Jurors 3  4  and.
Outraged.
The proceedings have gone.
People can not be trusted.
They are little better.
One remains.
He speaks.
The other jurors turn their backs  starting with Juror 5  until only Juror.
Confused and disturbed  Juror 10 continues in a steadily fading voice and manner  concluding with the entreaty  Listen to me.
Now sit down and do nt open your mouth again.
He states his belief.
When Juror 4 is pressed as.
The fact remains that the woman who saw the murder from her bedroom window across the street still stands as solid evidence.
Juror 12 changes his vote back to make the vote 8-4 again.
He points this out.
8 test.
When 4 states that he does nt believe the boy s alibi  which was being at the time of the murder.
Well 4 can remember the events.
8 explains.
When 4 only remembers the events.
Being can make you forget certain things.
There was no reason to think.
4 had nt been.
The boy could remember the movie he saw.
Then Juror 9   realizes  he cannily asks Juror.
The witness who allegedly saw the murder had impressions in the sides of her nose  indicating that she wore glasses  but out of vanity did not wear them in court.
He wears his eyeglasses to sleep.
Juror 4 admits - no one does.
He does nt.
Juror 8 explains.
There was thus no reason to expect that the witness happened to be wearing her glasses.
He points out.
The attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on.
Jurors 12  10  and 4 all change their vote.
He points this out.
The only remaining juror with a guilty vote is Juror.
A long argument culminates in 3 revealing.
He had had a poor relationship.
His anger is the main reason.
He wants the defendant to be guilty.
Juror 3 loses.
His temper and tears up a photo suddenly breaks down crying and changes his vote to not guilty  making the vote unanimous.
8 helps the distraught.
The jurors leave the room.
The story ends.
When the friendly Jurors 8 and 9 exchange names  and all descend the courthouse steps to return to their individual lives.

All donors are modeled  meaning that they are cloned from the people lowest in society  or  in her words  in the gutter.
Kathy and her friends hear rumors of the possibility of deferral - a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors and can somehow prove it.
Who are.
Tommy becomes convinced.
The Gallery was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to the Gallery will be able to verify true love.

Fearing an attack  the lab company owner  Dr William Reisner  employs Turner and his partner  Detective Lisa Martinez  to protect Maggie  but refuses to divulge any information to the detectives on the nature of the work.
They are doing.

Meanwhile  Bishop and Reisner  knowing  make Turner.
Their work and careers would end if Maggie talks.
Maggie does relent and tells the whole story  a team of molecular biologists broke the code for human invisibility  but almost overnight something went seriously wrong.
All but two were killed.
The program was scrapped.
One year later  the Reisner Institute was contracted to restart the experiments  with covert funding from the Department of Defense.
The operations was codenamed Silent Knight.
The idea was to create the ultimate national security weapon  an undetectable soldier.
Reisner managed to reproduce the original test results.
A flaw was found -  it has horrible adverse effects.
The serum turns human tissue invisible.
Simply put  the serum allows light to pass directly.
The radiation damages the cells and causes physical and mental degradation.
It kills them.
Maggie   developed a compound to protect a person.
Who was called in to correct the defects.
Was called the Buffer.
Eventually the project was cleared.
One specific soldier  Michael Griffin  a highly distinguished Special Forces operative and Bishop s protege volunteered to become the first invisible soldier for the United States Army.
Who served  happily.
The test   succeeded.
Which Dylan was revealed to be the one who administered the serum.
The results were favorable  but  it somehow failed.
When the Buffer was injected.
Griffin suddenly died.
Maggie was fired.
Maggie believes.
Griffin faked his own death so he can use his powers.
He needs the antidote.
He dies.
Back  Reisner and Bishop argue.
Turner is not the only threat  referring to Griffin.
Bishop insists.
He can bring him  as he knows Griffin has always worked on the edge of anarchy and when he goes into combat he goes deep and goes black.
Bishop says.
When Reisner pointedly asks why would he listen.
I m still his CO  but reluctantly agrees to not let Griffin get the Buffer or Maggie.
Maggie receives a text message.
She explains.
Ludlow has been contacting her  giving her warnings and subtle pieces of advice about the program.
Needing a way to fight Griffin  Turner uses his street contacts to find Ludlow s hiding place.
Turner and Maggie eventually find him and discover.
Ludlow  previously known  was a soldier enlisted into the program before Griffin but after the first one.
He fled.
The program  but due  is slowly dying.
Ludlow has been keeping track  and reveals the true story to his supposed death.
The program itself  Operation Silent Knight was never  but political security  and as such Griffin was intentionally not given the Buffer.
Bishop and Reisner wished to use Griffin to assassinate the United States Government s political enemies.
Griffin s victims then became.
More randomized  and as such Griffin has begun targeting ordinary civilians  all over the last two weeks in the North Western United States.
Meanwhile  Griffin makes his way  murdering all the army guards in his way and proceeds to take Bishop hostage.
Bishop attempts to reason.
The Silent Knight program needed a fail safe to ensure its integrity.
Griffin no longer needs Maggie.
He can get Griffin the Buffer.
He turns himself.
Griffin  however  does not trust him.
Getting desperate  Bishop shouts.
If not  Griffin would have been court martialed for what he did in Iraq  and stabs him with a pen.
Griffin responds  and locates Ludlow on Bishop s computer.
Griffin arrives and attacks Turner.
Ludlow saves him.
Griffin snaps Ludlow s neck.

It is Griffin.
He can have the Buffer sent within 10 minutes.
The figure replies.
I m not Michael.
It is Turner.
Who used Griffin s discarded syringe to hide.
Reisner   backs away from him too far and is hit by a speeding car and killed.
Griffin takes Maggie.
That she can create the Buffer.
Griffin  still suspecting foul play  forces Maggie to inject herself first  to make sure.
Maggie supposedly makes enough to save his life.
It is not fake.
It will not kill him.
Griffin  wanting to make sure  tries to kill Maggie.
His secret will stay secret.
Turner attacks and knocks Griffin out.
Before he can.
Turner runs outside to see  but he has survived.
Griffin died.
Griffin attacks him and knocks Turner unconscious.
Griffin tries to kill Maggie again  but stops.
No one left to help her.
When he finds he is slowly turning visible.
Maggie reveals.
He has  indeed.
Buffer is based.
Maggie deliberately left the doses.
She made just toxic enough to kill them both  and loses consciousness.
Enraged  Griffin takes a shovel and attempts to kill Maggie.
A now-conscious Turner stops him and knocks him.
Griffin asks Do you feel it yet  Turner.
Turner calmly replies Not yet  and kills Griffin.
Turner looks down  thinks  and then says now I do.
Turner gathers Maggie and then carries her away for medical attention to the poison  leaving Griffin s body outside in the rain.
A few days later  Maggie is recovering and is poised to be released.

Hollywood movie star April Tremaine is posing for photographs in Chicago.
When her overly opinionated director  Ivan Ivansky  suddenly orders the newspaper reporters and photographers.
He tells her.
They are out.
Her next film has to differ to the previous ones.
April is horrified to know.
In order to accomplish this  he has decided she has to have a baby.
Her complaints fall to Ivan.
Who charges his press agent  Patsy Riley.
Patsy s first thought is to enlist the help  an old boyfriend of hers and one of the regular drivers of the PRR s top-link express train  the Broadway Limited.
Mike is at first delighted.
When he hears that they are travelling  but is less enthused when he is assigned to try to find the baby required for the stunt.
An unknown man nearby overhears  and makes a telephone call.
He gloomily outlines the problem.
He has solved his problem.
Mike is so glad to see his dilemma solved - but unknown  the kidnapping of a baby belonging to family named.
He vows to remain his lifelong friend.
Pierson has made headline news.
April s adopted baby attracts a great deal of attention from news reporters.
They are watched.
They board the Broadway Limited.
Mike has been rostered to Fort Wayne.
Where another crew is waiting to take the train.
He informs his fireman.
They make their way.
He is taking his holiday  and wo nt be returning to Chicago with him.
The fireman is rather taken aback.
When he hears that Mike is travelling.
Meanwhile  Patsy is met.
Patsy is just showing her.
When she is called away.
He does nt immediately recognise Miss Prottle and firmly orders her out.
When Ivan eventually emerges.
She re-enters shortly  but this time she is on hand to explain.
Miss Prottle.
April is having trouble with the baby again  but is nt sure.
To stop him crying.
Thinking  she leaves him and goes to the buffet in the observation lounge.
He may be hungry.
Where she unexpectedly meets up  Dr Harvey North  who remembers her by her real name of Mary Potter.
Their brief gossip is interrupted  Harvey   follows to see.
When Patsy reminds April.
Who is especially gifted.
He can help.
She confides  nurturing her very own child - and a young husband.
When they get back.
Ivan may have a point in what he had said to the station  about being at home.
Realising  Patsy rushes back.
She is thinking.
Meanwhile  Harvey is rather taken aback  almost as.
He were her own.
April tries to explain  but Harvey can not bring himself to believe this.
It is merely a publicity stunt.
He denies.
When she asks  unaware that he is fearful of losing his leading lady.
He had anything to do.
Displeased  Harvey walks out and returns to the observation saloon.
An angry April forces Ivan and Patsy out.
Mike hands his engine  K4 No.
3763  over crew and joins the train itself.
He is briefly harassed before being joined at his table by Harvey.
He is waiting.
Patsy enters the dining car.
Seeing Harvey  April tries once again to reason with him.
Harvey still does nt believe her.
She gets her way by telling him.
Ivan was the father.
Ivan soon approaches her table  and is confused.
When Harvey threatens to knock his teeth before storming off.
April smugly repeats.
What she had said.
Horrified  Ivan leaves the baby to his compartment to pack his suitcase  ordering the train porter to stop the train and let him off in spite of it being scheduled to run straight through to Harrisburg.
The porter has only just gone to talk.
When Harvey comes to interrogate Ivan.
Ivan reveals  leaving Harvey rather ashamed of himself.
He can do so.
It was indeed a mere publicity stunt.
Mike has joined Patsy and Miss Prottle on their table and is explaining to Miss Prottle about various aspects of railroading.
He has just finished explaining.
He once avoided crashing  causing Mike to leap from his seat and yell a greeting.
He explains.
A friend/relative was driving the goods engine.
Eventually  Patsy and Miss Prottle head off to help April.
Patsy and Mike agree to meet later on.
She leaves.
Mike is just leafing through a newspaper.
When another passenger comments.
He adds.
The last such crime was foiled.
Mike is shocked.
When he reads that the baby is similar in appearance to the one lent to April Tremaine  and was believed to have been heading east.
He hastily leaves the saloon and heads.
When he sees that the other passenger is a detective.
Has nt been seen yet.
Patsy and Miss Prottle have the baby ready for bed.
Miss Prottle insists.
Which she is a big fan.
Mike hastily offers to look.
While they go and listen.
As soon  the suspicious character looks to Mike about the baby  adding.
They have gone.
He will be right outside if he needs any help.
He shuts the door.
Mike pulls the baby s shirt down to look.
Sure enough  he sees a dark patch similar.
Renfrew of the Mounted is just finishing.
Patsy is so annoyed  and accordingly walks out on him.
She mistakes it in her.
Realising  Mike reacts.
He is.
Meanwhile  Harvey tries to apologise to April for his misunderstanding.
April refuses to hear him out.
Ivan   steps in and reminds Harvey  and advises.
Who had opted to stay after all.
He is a mere  underpaid doctor.
He should nt interfere any longer.
However  his guilt quickly catches up again.
Suspicious that Ivan may have ulterior motives  Harvey reluctantly agrees.
His attempts to make up are constantly foiled by Ivan staring warily out of his compartment.
Ironically   Harvey catches him out.
Every time he himself tries to talk.
This goes on.
They catch Mike leaving April s compartment.
Both are taken aback  unaware.
Mike was really helping to open April s suitcase.
Later that night  Patsy is woken.
Who tells her that  unbeknown until too late  the baby had been kidnapped.
Thankfully  Patsy has a plan  and puts Mike.
They get a chance to drop him off.
Mike takes the baby back and keeps.
Him occupied.
Shortly  Patsy comes and informs him.
The train has made an unscheduled stop.
Mike takes this opportunity to leave the baby.
The suspicious man finds the baby.
As he leaves the building.
He screws up the note and surreptitiously returns the baby.
He finds  there is a flood.
When Mike returns.
The train is being held up.
The express engine has been commandeered to take a consignment to the town affected by the flood.
The other engine  a D16  is unable to make it fast enough.
Mike suggests.
They use the smaller engine to pull the Broadway Limited.
The driver and fireman are sceptical  saying.
They could nt get enough head.
Mike however is insistent  and challenges the superintendent  Mulcany  the engine for him.
Mike and Mulcany prepare the.
No.
3673 is shunted.
The D16 slips violently.
Mike manages to get the express rolling again.
Back  Miss Prottle realises and frantically tells Ivan.
The baby is missing.
Who orders the guard to call.
Patsy overhears and rushes Miss Prottle back before repeating to Ivan.
What Mike had told her.
Realising  Ivan rushes off to order the guard not to send off the message  only to find.
They are headed if the police are sent for.
He is too late.
But almost immediately  he remembers.
He finds this out.
The baby is missing anyway  so they have no need to worry.
Meanwhile  April is woken up to find the baby.
She sees a chance to make up her dispute  and asks the porter to send for him.
Confused. 
He deduces  but kindly offers to stay and keep an eye.
When Harvey arrives.
The baby just is nt tired  much.
April is beginning to realise just  and expresses to Harvey a desire to have one of her own.
Right Ivan was.
Ivan s words are still playing  however.
He is therefore rather pessimistic.
April tells him that she has had enough.
They both head off.
The two share a kiss.
As Ivan opens his door.
Ivan is horrified   but also.
Only because Harvey went back.
They leave.
Ivan pacing back and forth  ranting and raving to himself in Russian as he tries desperately to work out a way round it.
Ivan is still pacing in his compartment  unable to sleep.
When he hits.
Excited  he heads off and  admitting  proposes to build Harvey s life-ambition - the finest clinic can buy.
He has been rather heartless up.
Science can dream.
Harvey is unconvinced.
Ivan promises to pay him the required $ 50000 and give him a contract.
He leaves the train.
The express enters Harrisburg.
They are discussing this.
Where it is to change engines and proceed.
As soon  Mulcany congratulates Mike and wishes him a nice holiday.
They have stopped.
Mike returns  unaware.
The police have begun to search the Limited.
Ivan confides in Harvey about their predicament  and is shocked to hear from Harvey.
The baby is still.
He runs back.
Where April is just dressing the baby.
He had been kidnapped.
Patsy enters shortly  and is shocked to find the baby on April s bed.
Ivan hands her the baby and forces her before hastily organising a ruse with April  as soon  April pretends to be distraught.
The policeman enters.
Ivan keeps him occupied.
Back  Mike comes to inform Patsy.
Everything is.
Patsy reveals.
The baby is back aboard the train  much.
He takes the baby back in time to avoid being caught out by Miss Prottle and the policeman.
Whom Miss Prottle mistakes.
The policemen soon come  and head back to make their report.
The baby is nt.
The engines changed  Mike heads.
Ivan  Patsy  April and Harvey try to find a way out.
Ivan suggests.
They get off.
Patsy reminds him.
They will be rounded up even if they do nt stay on the train until New York.
The suspicious man is met by another two men.
Who join the train to New York.
Back  Patsy  Harvey  April and Ivan are still desperately trying to find a solution to their problem.
Miss Prottle points out that they are all heroes.
Harvey and April realise  they just have to hand him.
They need nt have worried after all.
They will be.
Mike comes in and announces.
He is going to surrender as soon as they reach New York  to which all eagerly agree.
Patsy sends him to get the baby.
Mike  elated  instantly obliges.
When he hears that they will all be received.
The guard hands Ivan the contract and a $ 50000 cheque for the clinic.
Harvey is just signing the contract.
When Mike bursts back  saying that the baby has gone.
All six spread out to look for the baby.
Whom Mike eventually finds.
He approaches him  demanding the baby back.
The other two passengers try to restrain him.
Mike  however  is too strong  and knocks them down before hanging the suspicious passenger on the.
Patsy enters and is about to take the baby and bar her way  only to be overpowered once again.
When the other two passengers come round.
It is revealed  he had let them use the baby for the publicity stunt on the basis.
The Pierson baby had been found the night  and that the suspicious-looking man was actually the baby s father.
He could use the $ 500 reward.
The other two characters  he adds  are his brother and.
Mike points out.
What he believes is a mole.
It turns out to be a false beauty mark.
Miss Prottle had lost.
Patsy heads off to Niagara Falls with Mike.
The flustered father leaves.
However  they read and find.
Harvey and April leave.
The clinic is to be located right indicating that Ivan intended to keep April as his leading lady without interfering too much with her private life with Harvey.

When all the air leaves him.

Finally  he falls down and has to hold  then ends up twisted inside the bucket.
The coyote unties the rope  but then sees.
Was the very rope holding himself up.
He hides.
When it hangs itself up on a tree branch.
Wile relaxes hunched until the excessive weight on one side causes the coyote to fall out again and down to the ground.
The Road Runner provides a convenient spring.
Wile thanks his rival and is hung up by the wire.
He is bounced directly up.
.
Wile hammers a Detour sign  directing the Road Runner to go down a very dangerous outcropping.
The Road Runner stops.
The coyote follows  trapping the bird.
Wile licks his lips  prepares his utensils and walks to eat him.
The bird stands still  showing no sign.
Then the thin outcropping breaks and sends Wile.
His own utensils follow him down  scrape the skin  and spear his tail  despite his efforts to avoid them.
If that was nt enough.
The coyote leaps all the way and rejoins his napkin.
Both are hung up.
The entire tree then falls down  pounding the coyote.
Wile can not fight the flow  and is swept downstream.
His arm protrudes out.
He twists the spigot.
The rest comes out  leaving Wile staring at the Road Runner  still standing on the floating piece of rock.
Wile  depressed and embarrassed  holds up a sign  I would nt mind -.
That he defies the law.

The first part explains the origin of Islamism and.
It shows Egyptian civil servant Sayyid Qutb  depicted  visiting the U.
S.
To learn.
Becoming disgusted.
What he saw in western society through individualism.
He is disturbed under Gamal Abdel Nasser and becomes convinced.
When he returns.
In order to save society it must be completely restructured while still using western technology.
He also becomes convinced.
This can only be accomplished to lead a revolution against the established order.
Qutb becomes a leader and  after being tortured in one of Nasser s jails  comes to believe.
Western-Influenced leaders can justly be killed.
Qutb is executed.
He influences the future mentor  to start his own secret Islamist group.
Inspired  Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president Anwar Al Sadat  in 1981  in hopes of starting their own revolution.
The revolution does not materialise.
Zawahiri comes to believe  but Muslims themselves have been affected and thus.
The majority have been corrupted not only by their western-inspired leaders.
Both may be legitimate targets if they do not join him.
They continued to have the belief.
A vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime and replace.
A group of disillusioned liberals  including Irving Kristol and Paul Wolfowitz  look to the political thinking of Leo Strauss after the perceived failure of President Johnson s Great Society.
They come.
The emphasis was the undoing of the plan.
They envisioned restructuring America  and set about creating a mythical enemy.
These factions  the Neo-Conservatives  came Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld  and work to unite the United States in fear of the Soviet Union.
The Neo-Conservatives allege  and   they accumulate a case to prove this with dubious evidence and methods.
The Soviet Union is not following the terms.
President Reagan is convinced nonetheless.
Islamist factions  rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich Saudi acolyte Osama bin Laden  join the Neo-Conservative-influenced Reagan Administration to combat the Soviet Union s invasion of Afghanistan.
Both groups believe.
When the Soviets eventually pull out and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse.
They are the primary architects.
Curtis argues  and were doomed to collapse.
The Soviets were anyway.
However  the Islamists see.
It quite differently  and believe that they had the power to create ` pure  Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria.
However  attempts to create perpetual Islamic states are blocked.
The Islamists then try to create revolutions by the use of terrorism to scare the people into rising up.
However  the people were terrified.
The Algerian government uses their fear.
The Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries as inherently contaminated by western values  and finally in Algeria turn on each other  each believing.
Other terrorist groups are not pure enough Muslims either.
The Neo-Conservatives  aspirations to use the United States military power for further destruction of evil are thrown off track by the ascent of George H.
W.
Bush  followed by the 1992 election of Bill Clinton leaving them out of power.
The Neo-Conservatives   attempt to demonise Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality.
However  the American people do not turn against Clinton.
The Islamist attempts  leaving the Islamists without popular support.
Zawahiri and bin Laden flee and declare a new strategy  to fight Western-inspired moral decay they must deal a blow to its source  the United States.
The final episode addresses the actual rise.
Curtis argues.
Bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support  let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists  and were dependent upon independent operatives to carry out their new call for jihad.
However  the film argues that to prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the 1998 U.
S.
Embassy bombings  US prosecutors had to prove he was the head.
They find a former associate and pay him to testify.
Bin Laden was the head.
Bush use this created concept.
The Neo-Conservatives focus inwards  searching unsuccessfully.
The American invasion fails to uproot the alleged terrorist network.
They then extend the war to a war against general perceived evils with the invasion of Iraq in.
The ideas and tactics also spread.
Where Tony Blair uses the threat to give him a new moral authority.
The repercussions are also explored with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay.
Allegedly taken without actual investigation on the part of the United States military.
Other forms made simply on the grounds.
The parties involved could later become a threat.
Curtis also makes a specific attempt to allay fears  and concludes by reassuring viewers.
Others altogether devoid.
When all the grand ideas have lost credibility.

Later   an argument breaks out over.
Whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband.
Perchik addresses the crowd and says.
Since they love each other  it should be left to decide and creates further controversy by asking Hodel to dance with him.
The two begin to dance.
Gradually  the crowd warms -- with Tevye and Golde joining  then Motel and Tzeitel.
The wedding then proceeds.
Suddenly  the military presence arrive and begin a pogrom  attacking the Jews and their property.

The adolescent Jae-yeong tells her classmate and best friend Yeo-jin the tale of an Indian prostitute named Vasumitra.
Whose clients  as the curious legend goes  became devout Buddhists with her.
It is an innocuous topic  a transactional date arranged by Yeo-jin on her friend s behalf through an online chat.
Takes  as the demure Yeo-jin helps the more uninhibited Jae-yeong apply make-up in preparation for a rendezvous with an older client.
The fanciful Jae-yeong interprets the anecdotal spiritual awakening to Vasumitra s feminine prowess.
It is this naive belief.
Seems to embolden.
Determined to reach their superficial goal to be able to travel to Europe  and seemingly obsessed with the mythical prostitute s powers of transfiguration  Jae-yeong exhibits a fearlessness of consequence.
One afternoon   will lead to an irrational and tragic leap of faith.
The recurring theme defines the course of the film.
Yeo-jin attempts to come by retracing her friend s liaisons through a meticulously kept personal diary that had also served as an account of their financial progress towards their hoped-for European trip.
Contacting each client  Yeo-jin embarks on a guilt-ridden journey of sexual and financial restitution  arranging to reunite with each of Jae-yeong s dates  consummating their transaction  revealing the plight of the first Yeo-jin  then concluding their meeting by returning the money once given to her friend by them.
Her unexpectedly sincere  obliquely Samaritan act proves cathartic  turning their seemingly inconsequential dalliance with the under-aged prostitute into a humbling moment of reckoning for the transgressions and emptiness in their own lives.
However   the toll becomes even more unbearable into prostitution  a discovery.
Her doting father  a widowed police detective named Yeong-ki who  already grieving  becomes an inadvertent witness to his only child s unfathomable descent.
Ironically occurs as he investigates the crime scene.
Consumed  he begins to follow.
She conducts her bizarre  invariable after-school routine.
Consisting and exploring such spiritually fundamental themes as sin  moral bankruptcy and atonement  the film suggests a cursory - but fitting - modern-day parallel to the tripartite structure and redemptive themes of Dante Alighieri s epic narrative poem  The Divine Comedy.
Set  The Samaritan Girl is a figurative descent into the soulless  impersonal spaces of anonymous Internet chat rooms  tawdry love motels  and secluded public parks.
These are the spaces.
Jae-yeong inhabits  and that Yeo-jin must later traverse in order to expiate her own feelings of culpability.
Moreover  the film is also a chronicle.
Motivates the actions.
It is this figurative Christ-like.
Is illustrated.
The title provides a further useful insight into the thematic structure of the film.
Alluding to the contrasting movements within a single musical composition  the film is also an illustration of contrasting reactions to similar transgressions.
The recurring images are intimate  supportive  and even purgative.
The image of Yeo-jin s shower after leaving the hospital - later recalled in a similar shot of Yeong-ki - is devastating  isolated and bereft.
They can not forgive themselves.
Yeo-jin and Yeong-ki can see.
Inasmuch serves.
A passive and enabling protector becomes more complex and inescapable.
Resorting and recounting cryptic  Fatima-like visions of apocalypse to a preoccupied Yeo-jin  Yeong-ki does not confront his daughter with his shattering discovery  instead  he turns his grief inward and begins to confront his daughter s dates after their encounters with her.
He drives her.
Casting the proverbial first stone  Yeong-ki s innately protective paternal role turns from brooding sentinel to avenging angel.
Doggedly navigating the inhospitable terrain using an innate compass.
Elusively  but transfixedly  points home.
