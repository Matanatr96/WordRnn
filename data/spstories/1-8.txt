She comes with the local police and the two flee to Los Angeles and then move to New York.

One day   a fat lady dressed catches Julio s attention.
Julio and Atong are shopping.
Julio immediately runs and attempts to follow this woman.
He successfully locates the woman and approaches her.
However   the lady yells.
He could even say anything.
Julio instantly flees.
Order to prevent a scene to be made.
Julio runs back.
Both leave the area  much to Atong s chagrin.
Eventually  the construction is nearing completion.
It is natural.
Order to lessen the number.
A handful are laid off from work.
Julio is one.
Julio gets slowly overwhelmed.
His time becomes much longer.
Julio sees a waitress being abused and berated by her employer.
Having coffee.
This leaves Julio all somber.
Julio would often reminisce of his simple life in the province.

He then catches a glimpse by the lit window.
Julio can not believe  addressing her.
What he saw and immediately calls out.
But his call was not heard.
He can see.
The room is already dark.

He is looking.

Julio   does not join the others and instead distants himself from a far vantage.
Ligaya sees Julio  and likewise.
The latter is deeply hurt to even approach her.
She then gets.
That is the last time.
Julio will ever see Ligaya.
Regretting the actions  Julio travels.
He did.
Order to search.
As soon  he was looking everywhere.
Julio arrived.
Then one day  Julio happened at Mrs Cruz walking by some street.
Julio followed her.
She stopped to Ongpin and Misericordia.
Julio seemed curious  so he entered the building one time.
He wounds up upon a large unit there.
He checks to see.
People are.
An old woman responds and asks.
Who is he looking.
Julio tells the woman that he is looking.
The old woman claims and asks the other person guarding the place  an old man.
He knows Ligaya.
The old man becomes hostile and denies.
He even knows and slams the door.
Hence  this is the reason.
Julio poses  to keep a look out for Ligaya  if ever she leaves the building.

To make matters worse  he finds out.

They are to meet by midnight and leave Manila together.
Ligaya is initially reluctant.
Ah Tek might find out.
Julio promises her.
He will wait three more hours.
Ligaya then agrees.
Julio patiently waits for Ligaya until the wee hours of the morning  only for the latter not to show up.
Thinking  this saddens Julio.
Ligaya broke her promise.
He returns.
Pol  being aware.
Depressed his friend is.
Julio complies.
Pol tries to lighten the mood but fails to do.

Whose life is depicted.
The four great era or epochs are  Satya Yug  Treta Yug  Dwapar Yug and Kali Yug.
Satya Yug or the Age is said to last for four thousand divine years  Treta Yug for three thousand  Dwapara Yug for two thousand.
Kali Yug will last.
It is also believed.
Three have already passed.

Kali is left.
Evil and dishonesty has replaced truth or yugs.

Is undetectable.
Security guard Ted Pikul  rushes and escorts her outside.

Pikul realizes.
It is hard to tell whether his or Allegra s actions are their own intentions or the game s.

When they meet DArcy Nader  a video game shop owner.
Allegra informs him.
It was the doing.
Reality becomes more distorted.

The other patrons of the restaurant appear more frozen than shocked  and return to their meals.
When Pikul tells them it was a simple misunderstanding.
Hugo Carlaw informs them.
When the pair return.
Nourish is actually a double agent.

He is shot by Vinokur.
Carlaw can kill Allegra.
Who is a double agent.
He informs Allegra.
He copied her game data while he was fixing her pod.
She kills Vinokur.
Pikul then reveals  he is a Realist.
He himself was sent to kill her.
However  she informs him  then kills him.
She knew ever since he pointed the gun at her in the Chinese restaurant.
The two then appear on a stage  together with the main players from the game.
It turns out.
The story itself is in fact a virtual reality game called tranCendenZ played  mirroring the first scene.
This is enforced.
Another difference occurs.
When it is revealed that players are using electronic devices rather than game pods.
The real game designer  Nourish  feels uneasy.
The game started and had an overall anti-game theme that he suspects originated from the thoughts of one of the testers.
Pikul and Allegra approach him and ask him.
He should pay.
Pikul and Allegra grab pistols hidden and shoot Nourish and Merle to death.
Merle  Nourish s assistant  calls.
The other players appear more frozen than shocked.
They aim their guns.
Pikul and Allegra leave.
Who played the Chinese waiter  who first pleads  then asks if they are still in the game.

William Hundert is a passionate Classics professor enthusiastic.
His class turns out to be a strict yet inspiring lesson.
Benedict s Academy.
They include laid-back Louis Masoudi  the introverted Martin Blythe  and the studious Deepak Mehta  all highly intelligent.
Hundert inspires his students to study hard to become one of the three contestants for The Emperor s Club and be crowned Mr Julius Caesar  a competition questions regarding the Classics.
Puts the top three students.
Where they will be asked.
He mentions.
When the headmaster explains the contest.
Martin s father was once a Mr Julius Caesar.
Hundert quickly gains the respect.
The school year gets off.
However  Hundert s tightly controlled world is shaken.
When a new student  Sedgewick Bell  walks.
Bell is the cocky son.
S.
Senator.
Who possesses none.
A fierce battle begins between Hundert and Bell.
Bell s rebellious nature quickly makes him the interest   he also freely shares pornographic material and is willing to play hooky and travel off-limits to a nearby prep school for girls.
He not only is willing to talk back.
Not to break the rules  Masoudi and even studious Mehta find themselves enjoying their rebellious tendencies with Bell.
Hundert humiliates Bell.
When he asks the class  in chronological order  all the Roman emperors.
The other students comply.
Who has not studied the course material.
Hundert also makes a trip.
C.
To meet.
Bell s father is clearly uninterested.
Benedict s  instead telling Hundert just to teach Bell lessons  giving Hundert some insight.
He can graduate.
Hundert returns.
Benedict s.
Where  Senator Bell chews out Sedgewick.
Hundert tries to develop a closer student-teacher relationship and become a mentor to Bell.
Order to help change him.
Bell starts studying  proving to be a bright student.
His grades improve enormously.
Bell finishes in Hundert s competition.
Precedes the Emperor s Club contest  along.
Bell had actually earned fourth place.
Hundert privately decided to raise his grade after reviewing it again  thus moving him above Blythe  the third place winner  whose father before him had been an Emperor s Club winner  putting him under much pressure to live up to his father s reputation.
Hundert is caught.
When he sees a despondent Blythe sitting all under a tree.
The entire school watches the competition.
The three contestants are quizzed.
The confident Masoudi is the first to make a mistake.
He is thus eliminated.
Hundert becomes increasingly suspicious raising his toga to his head to think.
He is urged to give Bell a pass.
When Hundert takes a recess to confer.
Senator Bell is.
But he then asks Bell.
Who was Hamilcar Barca.
Bell is stumped.
Mehta is crowned Mister Julius Caesar.
Afterwards  Bell admits to Hundert having cheated.
Bell could not take the pressure  and like his father  tried everything.
He could to guarantee a win.
The trust is broken.
Hundert does not publicize this.
He once had.
Students move up before their graduation from St.
Benedict s Academy.
Bell shown reverting and loss of interest in academia.
Bell is shown barely squeaking by in his classes  gaining acceptance to Yale University only on account of being Senator Bell s son.
Hundert regrets not being able to influence Bell more.
Twenty-five years later  Hundert is denied his bid to become headmaster by the board.
Who feel he lacks the ability to drum up financial donations.
Hundert immediately resigns.
Later he receives an invitation.
A chance to meet up at an event staged by a full-grown Bell.
Who is now extremely rich and successful.
He is impressed.
Reunited. 
Every one had done well since their days at St.
Bendict s and all had successful careers  with Deepak Mehta now a professor himself.
It is also revealed.
Sedgewick Bell agreed to donate an additional 25000 square foot addition.
Benedict library  Hundert presiding.
A Mr Julius Caesar rematch is held.
This donation would be ironic  seeing.
Hundert was denied becoming headmaster.
Yet he would be the linchpin responsible.
Bell talks to Hundert about.
His influence had really changed his life.
He hopes.
He would be able to regain his dignity.
An enthusiastic Hundert agrees to host once again.
And so the Emperor s Club contest is again played.
The three contestants still wearing togas  but.
Masoudi answers the first question wrong  then tries to guess the right answer in spite  humoring the crowd with fake Roman names such as Gassius Flatulus.
Again  the main competition is.
Both still remember their lessons.
Sadly.
Bell has changed.
Bell is cheating  this time.
Furthermore  any information can not be found in any textbook.
Had been a point Hundert had made way back when  explaining that without contribution to society  one is insignificant.
Therefore  the hired grad student can not feed Bell the correct answer.
He ca nt find it.
Mehta is crowned Mr Julius Caesar once again.
Bell congratulates Mehta  Bell announces.
He will be running.
S.
Senate just like his father  stressing taxpayer funding.
Hundert finally sees.
Bell only used the event to drum up support and to get contributions from his old classmates.
Hundert  as well as Blythe  based on his face  can scarcely believe it.
Hundert and Bell run.
Where Hundert confronts Bell.
Bell coldly goes on to tell Hundert.
Hundert has no accomplishments  whereas he will become a nationally famous senator no matter what the cost.
Bell also says.
It does not matter that he cheated  as life is full.
Just then  Bell s son   comes out.
Who had admired his father up.
Bell is left to face his son and rationalize his Machiavellian ways.
Hundert believes  too wrapped up to devote attention to his family and properly raise his son.
Bell will become just like his father was.
Hundert  realizing again  now recognizes the importance.
He has failed Bell.
Blythe know that he had given away Blythe s seat.
He confesses his action ago to Blythe.
Who attempts to be mature.
Then excuses himself  his mannerisms strongly suggesting he did not appreciate having old wounds reopened.
Hundert  feeling  contemplates his legacy.
He has failed two students.
Hundert wakes up the next morning and goes expecting one last breakfast with his pupils.
Instead  he finds an empty room and is told.
They have all left already.
Hundert dejectedly returns  only to discover.
The men had thrown him a surprise party.
All his students are.
Who is seen talking.
Nonetheless  the meeting is a joyous event.
His students talk.
About how much he has influenced them and how they are grateful that he was their teacher.
Mehta gives Hundert a gift to another.
Is an inscribed plaque quoting the value.
Hundert finally comes.
While he failed to turn Bell  he still has helped make many of his pupils into better men.
He realizes.
His value is not based.
He accepts the offer  going back as a teacher.
He is always welcome at Saint Benedict s.
Hundert thus returns.
Benedict s Academy and again teaches Classics.
It is also revealed.
One is Blythe s son  who is proud that his father was once Hundert s student.
Hundert then asks Blythe s son to read the plaque.
As young Blythe did.
Hundert then looks out the window to see Martin Blythe proudly waving  and an expression and gladness.
Hundert has found peace.
He has been truthful.
It s also noticed.
Young Blythe reads the plaque  while his father as a young boy had had trouble reading it  showing that young Blythe s father had taught his son what Hundert had taught him.

The story begins 65 million years ago  sometime.
A Tyrannosaurus rex is stalking a creature.
Has been raiding its territory and food sources.
The creature is revealed to be a juvenile prehistoric dragon.
The T.
Rex had not eaten and prepares to attack the young dragon  in an attempt to defend itself  the dragon extends its wings to give the illusion.
It is much larger than it really is  but the T.
Rex is not convinced and continues to advance.
The young dragon then tries another tactic  it utters a piercing scream.
Carries. 
The screech disorientates the T.
Rex  hurting its sensitive ears  the attack only goads the dinosaur on.
Suddenly  the dragon s mother swoops down.
Rex  slashing the dinosaur s skull.
Both animals cause serious injuries to the other  the T.
Rex breaks the female dragon s wing.
The dragon breathes a jet of fire at the Tyrannosaur s face.
The Tyrannosaurus limps away.
The female dragon is left unable for herself or her offspring.
At the London Museum of Natural History and Science  England.
Dr Jack Tanner  a young palaeontologist  is introduced.
Who has been fascinated.
Rex  Dr Tanner shares his theory.
Caused the damage with other palaeontologists.
He tells them.
The damage was caused to science.
However  he says  a blast was the cause of death.
It was not the talons that killed it.
Evidenced discovered down both sides of the skull.
Unfortunately  his colleagues are nt convinced.
Tanner s academic reputation is left.
Dr Tanner studies photographs taken of a new discovery at Romania.
Several human corpses  dating  were found in a cave in the Carpathian Mountains.
Some straying skiers were being rescued.
Along  a carcass of an unidentified animal was discovered.
The Romanian authorities ask the museum to investigate the find.
Most want nothing to do with the specimen.
Tanner asks.
He can go.
The museum agrees.
Tanner prepares to travel  under one condition -  they leave immediately   the body is shipped back to London.
It is a hoax.
It s.
Tanner  along  arrive to discover  Tanner wonders.
The remains have been moved off the mountain.
What evidence may have been lost.
The three scientists enter the shed and begin analyzing the specimen.
Where the carcass is being housed.
Tanner notes.
The creature has a scaly hide and a tail  suggesting a reptile  but also has wings and foot talons  characteristics.
He wonders.
When he finds the wings.
The creature could really fly  as its wingspan is too small to allow flight.
Tanner finds.
The bones have a honeycomb structure  which would allow for flight  being hollow but strong.
Internal scans show a huge heart  needed to pump oxygen-rich blood to the chest muscles during hard work  and two bladder-like structures.
Tanner suggests  the gas contained inside is hydrogen.
They could be gas bladders.
Is lighter and would give the creature extra lift.
He tells his associates.
The creature has everything needed but that they do nt add up.
Back.
Rex  the mother dragon is dead  having succumbed  the starving juvenile must now teach itself.
To fly.
Evading the scavengers seeking to feed  at present  only pterosaurs  but more dangerous creatures will come.
The juvenile begins to eat the only food source available  its mother s carcass.
An aged male dragon arrives to feast.
Eating. 
The juvenile  sensing danger  flees.
The older dragon  seeking fresh meat  gives chase.
The juvenile flees.
Where the adult male can not fly.
Body working overtime  the juvenile begins to make hydrogen  essential   nature kicks in.
The adult is gaining.
The juvenile regurgitates the contents and takes to the air  narrowly escaping the adult male.
Tanner inspects inside the mouth of the creature and declares it a carnivore.
Also notices molars and wonders.
He also notes a fleshy palate and wonders.
It could have been used to prevent backdraft.
Noting  he reconsiders.
The mouth shows no evidence.
He theorizes  explaining.
Dragons breathing fire is biologically possible.
The bombardier beetle can emit liquid.
The prehistoric dragon  now a young adult  is preparing to fight an alpha male.
It eats rock rich.
It goes to fight the other adult male.
Is found.
The young adult ventures of an old alpha male.
The two fight and the young male succeeds.
Tanner says  they need fuel  oxygen and a source.
To create fire.
He then realizes.
He had already found fuel than air.
He then takes samples.
They are rich.
Tanner is now convinced.
His theories have been correct.
The creature is a dragon.
Tanner begins to wonder.
Dragons survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event  when other large land-dwelling creatures did nt.
The narrator then explains.
The size of Mount Everest smashed into the Earth  wiping out nearly all life on the planet.
Sharks  coelacanths  turtles  and crocodiles.
All had one thing  they were all marine species.
Tanner then remembers.
Crocodiles also have a false palate  and deduces that it is an evolutionary relic passed down from a marine ancestor.
The narrator continues to inform us  but explains.
The land-dwelling prehistoric dragon was wiped out.
The prehistoric dragon was not the only dragon species alive.
There was also a marine dragon  a cousin  both descended from a common ancestor.
It is explained.
The marine dragon lived.
Its the flight bladders became swim bladders allowing extra buoyancy  the wings became vestigial and served.
The large tail became a rudder.
Some dragons returned and eventually made the transition back to land.
The land recovered.
Tanner suggests.
The legends were actually recollections of true encounters with marine dragons.
One discovers.
A fossil had been found in bamboo forest  in China.
Tanner theorizes.
The marine dragon came back and evolved into a new species in the bamboo forests of Asia.
The dragons are low-slung  elongated  and slender  all characteristics of a body recently adapted from water.
Tanner wonders.
This would have been suitable.
We are taken back 50000 years.
Here we are shown the newly evolved forest dragon  adapted.
We follow the dragon.
It stalks its prey  and discover that the dragon has evolved a unique adaptation  mimicry.
The dragon is able to mimic animals in distress.
The vestigial wings are too small to allow flight  the dragon only able to glide small distances.
The buoyancy let it tread less heavily and thus quieter.
When stalking prey.
The dragons also use their natural fire-breathing abilities to cook their captured prey.
The fur is not easily digested.
The dragon succeeds.
Another species watches the dragon s use of fire with inquisitive eyes  a species.
Will turn the dragon s own weapon  humans.
Tanner  after theorizing about the marine and forest dragons  begins to wonder.
What other dragon species may have evolved.
Tanner s associate shows him something strange.
He thinks.
They may be ribs.
The ribs are intact.
The three scientists lift the wings.
It has four legs and two wings.
Tanner is amazed saying  No vertebrate had six limbs.
Ever lived.
They check the DNA  knowing.
If it is not a hoax then the limbs will show up.
The DNA test shows.
The dragon has a genetic adaptation.
Tanner tells us  all depictions show them to have six limbs.
World mythology was correct all the time.
He cites the different depictions.
He dubs their carcass the mountain dragon  and wonders.
This is the dragon.
They perform one final check to see.
The three scientists prepare the dragon carcass to be packed up and shipped.
They missed anything.
They find the tip  Tanner goes to and find the sword.
Where the Romanian scientists are studying the human corpses.
The tip came.
The narrator tells us the dragons survived.
Who used the dragon s fire.
These encounters are recorded in folklore throughout the world.
Tanner discovers.
The human bodies show evidence  showing that the bodies were burnt.
Their dragon specimen never breathed fire.
He sees.
The Romanian authorities come.
The ovaries show no follicular activity  and concludes that their dragon was a baby.
The three scientists travel  hoping to find a nest.
We are taken back  to the Carpathian Mountains in the Middle Ages.
Dragons have been driven to live by encroaching human.
A female mountain dragon is searching  she marks her territory with her scent.
The female is.
The scientists arrive and find rocks.
Have been scorched.
They scan.
A male dragon arrives  having traveled to Romania from his territory in the Atlas Mountains.
The female goes.
Instinct then takes over.
The two begin their courtship ritual.
Where they fly then freefall together  only pulling apart at the last instant.
Tanner finds a nest  containing egg shell fragments and one intact egg.
Back we see the female dragon  using her fire to incubate the eggs inside the nest.
The male returns  with no food.
Instead  he brings another rock.
The female  now being very protective  allows the male to enter the cave and take care of the nest.
The male enters the nest and places the rock.
The female takes her turn.
The female returns and finds the male not attending to the eggs.
She quickly senses.
Something is nt right.
She finds out  one infant dragon has already died.
The temperature is dangerously low and attempts to raise it again.
The other can still be saved.
The male senses trouble and makes his escape.
The adult female has been stealing livestock.
Order to feed her young daughter.
A pair arrive to kill the dragon.
The adult female begins to teach her daughter the secret.
They find.
The young female can not defend herself because she can not breathe fire yet  and kill her.
The adult female returns and finds her daughter dead.
Both are soon killed by the enraged female  with one nearly managing to escape.
The adult female comes back into heat and begins trying to attract another mate.
The female hibernates.
Winter comes.
More warriors come and catch her with her gas bladder nearly empty due to hibernation and attack her.
She fights.
Bravely  cutting down the mercenaries until only one man is left  badly wounded.
He holds a spear upright.
She rears.
Her toppling corpse crushes the last mercenary.
She fatally impales herself.
Tanner discovers a chamber.
He enters it and finds the adult female.
Back  Tanner shows the specimens to his colleagues  the legends of dragons were real  but had been twisted.
The narrator tells us  The story picks up one year later.
Tanner  now Professor Tanner  is given a file.
Tanner opens the file to find photographs.
He looks.
His colleague tells him that they were taken only two months ago.
Tanner runs off ecstatic  flapping his arms  preparing to track down the dragon.

The hill covered will be her gift to him.
Su Ho quickly went and was overjoyed to see it covered with purple flowers.

Zinga is reluctant to accept these instructions  like ` breathing from the stomach  and ` singing from the breast   claiming.
He knows how to sing.
And he fights.
He does nt feel ` free.
His voice significantly lacks emotion.
When he sings freely.
But  he is persuaded to follow those doctrinaire rules and techniques.
His wife s comforting  mainly focussing.
Zinga becomes an international opera star and succeeds in all kind of concerts and dramas.
This brings him wealth and fame.

Eighteen months later  Tellis is persuaded to return to the force to investigate the murder of another undercover narcotics officer  Michael Calvess.
Tellis is reluctant.
His wife disapproves.
She wants him to spend more time.
However  realizing  he decides to read the files and eventually agrees to come aboard  on two conditions.
There is very little else he can do.
The first is.
He will receive a desk job if he secures a conviction.
The second is.
Another detective  veteran Henry Oak  whom Tellis becomes aware  is assigned to the case as well.
Tellis  reason is his opinion after reading the files.
The only useful pieces thus far came from him.
Tellis is also informed as a driven and effective policeman.
Who is also unstable.
Oak is assigned to the case.
The two begin to build rapport.
Here we learn.
Oak is a dedicated  although haunted cop who uses an excessive amount force when facing criminals.
Oak also believes.
The department just wants the case buried and forgotten.
Oak reveals.
His wife died  and that they never had any children together.
He recalls a drug bust decades prior.
Where he found a ten-year-old girl naked  who had been sold by her stepfather for rent money.
Oak became enraged and beat the man.

He was  hoping to make a decision about his own private life.

Oak kills him.
Returning home  Tellis is confronted.
Who leaves him as she can no longer bear to see him endangering his life.
Tellis and Oak are told.
The case has been closed  as the deceased suspect is quickly and conveniently determined to be Calvess s killer.
They are furious.
They believe the killer has yet to be found  and continue their investigation independently.
Oak determines.
The main suspects are hiding out.
Once there  Oak finds and disarms.
One suspect while Tellis chases one outside and shoots him.
Oak attempts to force a confession out.
They are both tied up.
Tellis is getting increasingly suspicious  especially after viewing many files.
Suggest Oak had been repeatedly discharging a lady who has been arrested.
Oak finds many police issue guns.
Belonged  and attacks both men violently.
Which point Tellis steps in to calm him down and tells him to get CSI tools.
Tellis locks the door  turns  and asks for the truth.
When he leaves the room.
The dealers explain.
Calvess was the one who blew Tellis  cover eighteen months ago  causing the shootout.
They also recount Calvess s degeneration.
Calvess tried to make a deal with the two dealers.
It went badly.
Oak arrived at the other end of the tunnel  trailing Calvess to confirm rumors.
He had become an addict.
Calvess went.
Was the dealers  justification.
The two men then ran off.
Oak neared and began firing.
Tellis leaves the room and confronts Oak  telling him  leaving a wound  before murdering Calvess himself for being a drug addict.
The dealers claim that Oak shot.
Oak denies this.
The issue is then brought up.
Kathryn was the ten-year-old girl.
It turns out.
Oak found all those years ago who was being prostituted.
He considers her a daughter.
He never had  and has remained close all this time.
He has since been protecting her.
She committed.
Tellis then tells Oak.
He is going to make the arrest.
Oak beats him and resumes brutalizing the dealers.
He turns the tape recorder back and attempts to beat a confession out of the two men  to shoot them.
Threatening. 
Tellis breaks  retrieves a gun  and enters the building.
He is forced to shoot Oak.
When he refuses to put his gun down.
Tellis runs to aid Oak and  realizing he s dying  pleads to tell him the truth about died.
What happened.
Oak explains.
It was Calvess who shot as they ran away from Oak  leaving the shoulder bullet wound.
Oak had an argument  explaining and was going to turn him in to the Department.
He had finally had enough.
Calvess took his own gun and shot himself in Oak s presence.
Oak had been protecting his name and family ever  so Calvess  wife can have his pension and support her two daughters.
Calvess  wife would not have received the pension.
The Department found it was a suicide.
Oak s motive was to convict Mike s murderers  the dealers had turned him into a junkie.
Who he felt.
Oak then dies  leaving the confession on tape.
The two dealers are arrested outside.
Tellis has a few minutes to decide.
Whether to hand the tape  a decision that is never revealed as the film s closing credits roll.
