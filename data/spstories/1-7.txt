To improve.
Todd repeatedly rebuffs them  claiming.
He just needs to practice and does nt need their help.
Todd derides the others attitude  telling them.
They need to want and expect to win.
It seems extremely unlikely they Todd and Alex  Elisa  Delia  and Ken will be able to set aside their differences for the greater good.

Alex does nt seem too interested.
He likes bowling because it s not the most popular thing to do.
He realizes.
His family need to do something to improve the fortunes or they ll be forced to sell it.
Todd is shown as continually improving as a bowler.

He and Mayor McLemore used to be best friends.
Todd does nt believe him.
When Alex mentions this.
Principal Morris has booked some radio time with Sweet Lou for Todd.

The next scene shows Elisa and Ken  discussing the recent turn of events.
Todd joins them  and relates the stress.
He feels.
He tells them.
Cool he thinks it is that their friends will still be their friends no matter what the result is.
Elisa and Ken respond.
They do want to win  but that they will be blamed for the win because of Todd.
Todd reconciles and agrees to go talk to Alex and try to get him to rejoin the team.
Causes Elisa.
He also says.
He s surprised at how good they ve become  and how much he enjoys bowling  despite his initial bias against it.
Finally  he thanks Alex.
Sports can also be fun  not just an intense.
He asks Alex to please return  and that tomorrow at the event  they ll just bowl for fun  win or lose  stating.
If he s driven Alex away he wo nt be able to have any fun.
He then reveals.
He s created new shirts.
Alex s shirt has the name Tex.
Todd says Alex looks.
Todd s shirt has the name Dirk.
Alex insisted he wear earlier.
Their goodbyes  Alex s dad comes outside and talks.
He reminds him.
Bowling is still fun  even if it s not quite what he wanted it to be.
He also tells Alex the story.
They used to be best friends and were the shortstop and second baseman.
High baseball team.
They both wanted to win the Mighty Apple really badly.
Mayor McLemore made.
A bad throw where making a good throw would have ended the game.
Kevin dropped the ball.
This event and wanting to win so badly tore them apart.
They were never friends.
They had been.
They blamed the Mighty Apple for this.
Kevin realizes now.
This is nt the case.
He uses this to Alex about wanting to win  but not at all costs  because letting this tear him.
Jeff apart was the stupidest thing.
To ever happen.
The next day  Alex is nowhere to be found.
The others have gathered.
The atmosphere is crazy.
There are even more people.
There were.
The mayors introduce the event  the Mighty Apple  and then the teams.
First  the Wolfpack are introduced.
This surprises Elisa  Delia  and Ken.
They ve never heard bowling before.
They question.
So many people would want to see them bowl.
Alex makes his triumphant return and tells them people.
Want to see them because our uniforms are so darn cool.

Heading  the East is ahead.
The West is working.
Gives them the opportunity to come back and win.
Alex needs to get 3 strikes.
Alex gets the first strike.
Much fun.
He should take his next shot.
They implore him to go bowl and stop fooling around.
He then successfully gets the second strike.
Finally   he successfully converts the third strike.
His success means.
The final East bowler needs to get 3 strikes to force Todd to make at least a spare to win.
Baron successfully obtains 3 strikes  putting the pressure.
Lucky the East is to have Todd McLemore coming up.
He wishes they had nt gone last so this pressure would nt be.
Everyone  especially Ken  tells him.
It s no sweat  since all he needs to do is get a spare.
Todd approaches the lane and fires a perfect shot.
Unfortunately a 7-10 split occurs.
He approaches his teammates and tells them.
They re going to lose now because he ca nt make this shot.
Delia speaks up and says.
They re not going to lose.
She can make this shot.
He verifies.
Delia can make this shot  then substitutes himself out.
This angers his father  Mayor McLemore.
Who orders him to unsubstitute himself because he s the best chance to win.
Todd shoots back Why.
Now I want you to go sit down and cheer.
Delia approaches the lane for the climactic shot.
However   she instead kneels down at the edge of the lane and puts her finger in the ball.
She gives the ball a gentle push down the lane.
Everyone  including both teams  are stunned and unsure of.
Someone would pursue such a strange tactic.
Delia gets up and walks away  not even looking and expressing complete confidence.
The ball slowly rolls.
Todd asks her you like to know.
She sits down.
She s ever tried this shot before.
Meanwhile  Sweet Lou is nearly having a heart attack.
Slowly the ball is moving.
Finally  the ball hits the 7 pin.
Spins and knocks it over.
This gives West Appleton a spare  the win  and the Mighty Apple.
Alex shares an emotional hug and tells them he s glad.
Bowling is still fun.
Todd shares a hug.
His Mom makes his Dad apologize.
Todd tells his Dad.
Bowling has taught him how to enjoy sports and not see them.
He now sees fun.
Todd still wants to win.
His dad begins to celebrate the fact.
The new school will now be named West Appleton Jr.
High  but Todd tells him.
It s not fair that someone loses their identity  and that the Alley Cats should get to decide the game since they won.
He did nt.
He eventually acquiesces and tells Mayor Hanburger.
This initially confuses Mayor McLemore.
They re not going to name the school.
Alex and the rest of the Alley Cats chime in and say.
They are going to name the school  and that it will be named Appleton Central.
Everyone ends up.
Happy and both the East and West celebrate.

He relieves Osborne and asks Hardy to leave.
He informs them.
Dunbar and Vilmer will be taken away shortly.

And he considers.
The investigation closed.

Where Vilmer had stowed cocaine.
They open it.

He asks.
West would nt tell Styles as soon as he suspected something.

West did in fact go  but that Styles was behind the drug dealing operation the whole time  that rather than side with West  Styles ordered Mueller and Kendall to kill him in the jungle and then poisoned Kendall afterward to keep him quiet.
Osborne  meanwhile  approaching the office  overhears  and secretly listens.

Osborne is about to leave the base for the night.
Hardy tells her that everything s fine and all she has to do concerning.
The shooting is Tell the story right.
Osborne recalls hearing that phrase  describing.
Members planned to cover up West s death.
Osborne suspects.
Hardy may be involved  especially since he hated West and because Section 8 contains West s former trainees.
She tails him out  and sees Pike run out from some roadside bushes and get into Hardy s jeep.
She follows them through the streets of Panama City crowded with costumed revelers and watches.

Was going on.
Mueller  Kendall and Vilmer were responsible.

To get rid.

The film ends with Deborah  Shunderson  and Barker in the audience watching Praetorius conduct the orchestra in the finale of Brahms s Academic Festival Overture  Gaudeamus Igitur.
The movie has a number of political overtones.
The review says.
The film is a reaction during the communist witch hunts of the late 1940s  early 1950s which were initiated by Senator Joseph McCarthy.
President was openly attacked by Cecil B.
DeMille  a once great filmmaker and hard-line conservative.
Mankiewicz was a liberal.
Who refused to denounce others working.
The film s investigative trial has parallels by anti-communist crusaders.
And  the lead character  played  declines to clear his own name by revealing the private business of another person  in this case a convicted murderer.
As some refused to name names.
The review said.
Although the movie is meant hunts it deals with many other issues  including the pregnancy of a single woman  the corrosive effect of unfettered capitalism  the human cost of the Korean war  among others.

Egaro celebrates the centenary.
Where Mohun Bagan snatched the shield July 1911 during a time when India was under British rule.
Egaro is also the first celluloid tribute.
Who won the shield  ten.
But Egaro is not just about football.
It is.
Where the killer took prominence not because it was a fight to finish  but because the final match was a battlefield where the winning could speed the movement.
It did.
The British felt pressurized enough to shift its capital from Calcutta to Delhi on December 12 the same year.
The film explores a parallel theme.
Nagendra leads a group to eliminate high-ranking British officers with indigenous bombs and fire-arms without harming the old  the women and the children.
He castigates one for paying more attention to football than to the revolution.
But  he is convinced.
This final match is no less he is leading.
He comes the same member.
He threw out to rise and play when he faints.
Mohun Bagan had entered the finals.
Xaviers and Middlesex thought.
Consolidated the team s confidence that the British teams were not as unconquerable.
East Yorkshire Regiment scored one goal sending the entire audience into a tizzy and depressing the home team.
But  the team scored two goals one by Captain Sibdas Bhaduri and the other by Abhilash Ghosh  a striker.
The preparation spans a major slice of the film including family and personal hurdles the team members face.
Abhilash is a student.
Abhilash s father does not care in a game.
Might anger the British rulers.
Abhilash himself begins to rethink his stance  he feels  has reduced his duties towards those.
He loves.
Sudhir Chatterjee  professor is insulted in the staff room by his British colleagues for daring to participate in a match against a British team.
The Principal suspends him indefinitely.
But Shibdas is determined to win.
If one or two drop out at the last minute.
They do nt.
Two British citizens prove.
They too  are human.
One is the match referee Puller.
Who refuses to bend by the powers-that-be to treat the match as a ` must-win-or-else  ego trip against native Indians.
The other is Piggot  a player.
Who was badly injured by an inadvertent kick delivered by Abhilash.
He gives Abhilash a clean chit.
The officers who visit him urge him to pronounce the Indian team player s kick as intentional.
Egaro is a sports film.
Where reality has been cocktailed.
This makes the film more entertaining and exciting  filled  hilarity  drama and a bit of romance thrown in delicately between Abhilash and Bina and the one-sided attraction his British colleague  the beautiful Elina feels towards her colleague Sudhir.
Her reactions.
She begins to fan herself rapidly to express her joy.
When Mohun Bagan scores each goal.
The reactions provide a wonderful sense of relief and bonhomie and solidarity and patriotism bonded as one.
Their acting is.
Three are professional football players.
One can not make the difference.
The cameos are wonderfully portrayed.
The revolutionary segment is a bit overdrawn and dramatic.
The tremendous violence.
Who kill revolutionary Satyen s grandfather.
The flames is a powerful touch.
Gopi Bhagat s cinematography is brilliant.
Indraneel Ghosh s art direction reproduces the period with brick walls with the plaster peeling off  the roadside shop selling hot fritters  the college staff room  the prison cell with amazing accuracy.
Mayukh-Moinak s music is very good.
The background score is a bit too loud drowning the ambient sounds and the dialogue at some places.
The cheering audience clapped each time  or   or.
A line was quoted.
When the home team strikes a goal.
When Mohun Bagan s name is mentioned with India and identified with the struggle for freedom.
Sadly  this history does not find mention up the voice-over aptly.
The sub-titling widens the horizons of the audience for the film.
One prays.
This goes out and gets an organized premiere all over India in recognition of a brave band of eleven players who contributed to our freedom.
