The film opens.
Where all the trains are fast asleep.
The shot begins to focus.
2  an American.
Is Casey s  which is slow asleep  and eventually cuts  where Casey is revealed to be sleeping in his engine cab.
Doffing his bedclothes  he checks his watch and realizing  hurriedly readies the engine to depart.
He is.
Mail is loaded  Casey sets off at a dangerously high speed through the maze of switches and sidings  nearly t-boning two other trains in the process before making it safely out of the yard.
The trip is uneventful.
We see Casey relaxing  casually stoking it one piece of coal at a time.
If it were a parlour stove.
Further on  however  the weather turns nasty  flooding the tracks and all but swamping the train.
Eight hours late  but nonetheless undaunted  Casey climbs up and uses his coal shovel as a paddle.
Before long  he has cleared the flood and is again.
No sooner is the train back up  screeching to a halt  standing in the middle of the tracks grazing  is a large brown cow.
Then Casey is forced to bring it.
Finally moves aside.
Unfortunately  a new problem presents itself.
A stereotypical villain has tied a lady to the tracks in front of Casey s train.
Unwilling to waste any more time stopping  Casey rushes forward and stands.
Which the train is about to run her over.
The villain turns and exclaims theatrically  Curses.
Hours later  night has fallen.
We find Casey s engine steaming.
Another stereotypical villain nearly brings things.
The train passes.
Who is not.
Casey s engine struggles  huffing and puffing  and continues on its way.
Again undaunted.
A short while later  the camera focuses.
They watch the train.
Casey is about to get his train attacked.
Casey is so caught up in stoking the boiler.
He is oblivious.
It is.
After he inadvertently picks up one.
He finally notices the uninvited company.
Even then  Casey is more annoyed and begins to fight the robbers  hitting them repeatedly with his coal shovel.
Continuing to stoke the boiler.
Casey checks his watch and is horrified to discover.
The robbers have put him once again.
Determined to make up  he opens the throttle so wide.
He actually rips the handle and throws it away.
The scenery outside quickly becomes a blur.
The train travels faster and faster.
He adds more coal.
He also uses his shovel and rocking chair.
When running out.
The ribbing is forced off.
Casey gives the engine some running repairs.
The train roars down a hill.
Just a bit away a double headed.
Slow freight train  double-headed is chugging towards Casey  who is too busy fixing the engine s dome to notice.
The brake-man runs up.
About the oncoming double-headed slow freight train is coming  but fails to get the message  and jumps off the train.
But here s a goof.
The brakeman is still seen on the engine s roof in the next shot.
The crews.
Who are approaching all gasp and abandon the train as well and run.
Afterwards  we are taken  presumably the one Casey is meant to terminate at  and  Casey being late  the Porter fears the worst.
Then  much  Casey rolls down the hill in the remains of his engine carrying a bag of mail.
A beaten up Casey then shows his watch  it stating.
He is ` ON.

Henry Wilt is a community studies teacher.
Where most seem to be fairly apathetic to learning.
Eva Wilt  his wife  is interested.
Eva s disdain adds to his general frustration at work  including being turned down for a promotion again  and leads him to occasionally fantasize about killing her.
Her friends Sally and Hugh only exacerbate his alienation by talking disparagingly about teaching as a profession and about his car.
He crosses paths by the incompetent Inspector Flint.
He is walking home and speaking out one.
Whose wire has fallen off.
Wilt intervenes and unknowingly helps the drug dealer to get away  thinking.
He is witnessing a mugging.

Evidence mounts.
He makes a phone call and pretends the answerphone is his wife while Inspector Flint is present.
Wilt initially claims.
He and his wife had an argument.
She disappeared.
He has no idea.
Where she is.
Inspector Flint superficially accepts this explanation and tells him he can go  only to be confronted by an old woman.
Who claims to have seen him repeatedly stab a woman.
Returning again  Wilt starts to go into more detail about the night of the party.
It is revealed.
Henry and Eva argued as normal  and that Sally is sexually interested in Eva.

Turns out to be a cupboard.

Flint is only because Inspector Farmelow is on holiday  and that it is generally agreed that this is a chance for Flint to gain a promotion.
The next day  they are preparing to bring up the body  much.
This coincides with the visit of a group of Japanese businessmen.
Who are being courted to sponsor the college.
The body  encased  is lifted out but slips free and is dropped onto the bonnet of a police car  freeing the blow-up doll  much to Inspector Flint s chagrin.
Undaunted  Flint determines.
The whole doll incident is just an attempt to cover up the actual murders of Eva  Sally and Hugh.
Wilt changes his story and starts telling Flint of his return to the mansion later the night of the party.
He claims to have attacked the alleged victims  and disposed of the bodies at the meat factory.
Where many work.
Flint launches a search using massive amounts to find the evidence of this  before his superior points out.
Wilt signed his confession Sweeney Todd.
Wilt is released.
His wife and her friends are still missing.
Meanwhile  Eva has been stuck with Sally and Hugh.

He tries to intervene.
Who has followed him.
Wilt hits him.
He has been given to dig up his wife s body and heads into the church where his wife has fled followed by the vicar.
